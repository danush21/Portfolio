						<br>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Danush Gupta. I'm a B.E student at Madras Institue of Technology - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer Science Department. I was born and raised in Chennai.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did my schooling majorly in Chinmaya Vidyalaya, Anna Nagar and Velammal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vidyalaya. School days were indeed the best days of my life.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to travel. I believe travelling gives you a new perspective to everything. You &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get to know a lot about the different cultures, the cuisines, their history, the language &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the small unique things every place has to offer. </p>
						
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to play football and hangout with my friends.</p>

                            <h2>Chris Gayle (aka Universe Boss)</h2>
                            <div class="divider-grey"></div>
							
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="./Danush Gupta_files/Pokf5j8Gevg.html" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

                            <p>Twenty20 cricket seemingly picked Chris Gayle as its ambassador, for he scored the very first hundred in the format and now uncontestedly owns almost every record there is, including that of the most runs (now 10,000+), most hundreds, fastest hundred, and most fours and sixes.</p>

<p>Chris Gayle might stand tall at over six feet and wield his bat to make or break T20 leagues, but make no mistake about his affinity for Test cricket. His absenteeism from Tests later in his career may seem to suggest otherwise but Gayle has racked up 15 Test hundreds and over 7,000 runs across 103 matches so far, and frequently turns up for his many T20 franchises in jerseys numbered 333 - his highest First Class score, which he made against Sri Lanka at Galle, to become only the fourth batsman after Don Bradman, Brian Lara and Virender Sehwag with two Test triples in a lifetime.</p>

<p>Renowned as one of the most barbarous hitters of the cricket ball ever - he once swung a Brett Lee delivery past the Lord Tennyson school outside Oval! - Gayle dismissed footwork to a famous cricketing redundancy of his time, and along with other contemporary opening batsmen in Tillakaratne Dilshan, Virender Sehwag, and Brendon McCullum later, fashioned a batting era characterized by an unreal dependence on hand-eye coordination and breakneck run-scoring across formats. No wonder he became the first batsman to hit the first ball of a Test match for a six. And it's only fair that he beat Sehwag to become the fastest double centurion in ODIs, minting 215 off 147 in a World Cup game against Zimbabwe in Canberra, 2015.</p>

<img src="./Danush Gupta_files/img/Chris-Gayle-Adieu-2-AP_571_855.jpg" width="70%">

<p>Being the first cricketer with hundreds in all three formats, Gayle deservedly personifies the weight struggle between various cricket formats that stood intensified with the launch of IPL in 2008. So in 2009, Chris Gayle arrived in England after playing seven IPL games to captain West Indies in a Test match at Lord's, a game that his side lost heavily amidst scathing criticism from media and fans alike.</p>

<p>Be it because of his growing T20 appetite, his never-ending conflicts with the West Indies Cricket Board, or his degrading fitness level, Gayle's international appearances have gone from few and far in between to very little off late, with his focus now on being a T20 freelancer, not singularly in an era where retirement-age dangerously seems to hover around thirty-two.</p>

<p>Debuting for West Indies as a 20-year-old in the year 2000, Gayle went on to captain the national side, taking over from Ramnaresh Sarwan. He didn't start as an opening batsman, but soon graduated into one, but despite well-timed performances and a good record, doubts over Gayle's technique against seam and swing have remained.</p>

<p>Come to the more batsman-friendly limited-overs format, and Gayle seems more at home. To quell his effectiveness at the top, captains have often preferred to start with off-spin, his branded nemesis, as typified by Ravichandran Ashwin's hold over him. If not that, teams have religiously relied on short-pitched deliveries, aimed at his ribs, which Gayle either top-edges or more often buries deep into the square leg stands. His long reach helps him to get to the pitch of the change-up full deliveries which he nonchalantly carves back over the bowler's head.</p>

<p>Gayle's aversion to running ones and twos - more conspicuous later in his career - shouldn't startle you as much as his reliance on them, rotating the strike early in his innings before unleashing a theatrical, sometimes unstoppable barrage of king-sized sixes all around. His wonderfully limited agility makes for memorable catches, especially in the slip cordon where he stands from time to time, courtesy merit or convenience, or both. His handy off-spin and the ability to skid the new ball through once guaranteed an automatic selection into any team, including that of the prying T20 leagues around the world.</p>

<p>Even as he belted records all over the place, Gayle'e mounting injury woes meant his stints with the West Indies national side have become rarer. He hasn't officially retired from Tests, he says his love for the longest form of the game hasn't ended, and fitness permitting, he would still love to add to his tally of 103 Tests. He's a man who leads by example. He's led his home franchise, Jamaica Tallawahs, to title triumphs in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) before shifting his allegiance to St. Kitts and Nevis Patriots - whom he took to the final in the fifth edition of the tournament.</p>

<img src="./Danush Gupta_files/img/Chris-Gayle" width="50%">
<p>Come to the Bangladesh Premier League, Gayle played for Rangpur Riders in the 2017-18 season and won the Player of the Series award for notching up the highest number of runs. Although he occasionally featured in T20Is for Windies, he wasn't a regular in the ODI setup. During Windies' tour of England in 2017, Gayle was recalled into the ODI side after a hiatus of more than 2.5 years. It was a start of a good run as he turned out in most games, helping Windies qualify to the 2019 World Cup and smashing England to all parts in the home series in early 2019. However, he lost form during the mega event which did not help the Caribbean side as they won only two games and finished ninth.</p>

<p><b>IPL - Through the years</b></p>

<p>Having lit up the 2007 World T20 with a stunning century in his first match, the big bucks were expected to flow in at the 2008 auction, and it was KKR, with a whopping 800,000 USD, giving him his first home. However, with West Indies generally touring during this period, and Gayle not quite hitting his groove, his biggest news-making headline in the first three seasons came when he extended his IPL stay to land at Lord's just a day before he was set to lead his side in a Test. But with middling form, both internationally and in the IPL in the past, he found no takers in the 2011 major auction, eventually needing an injury to Dirk Nannes for RCB to call him up as a replacement.</p>

<img src="./Danush Gupta_files/img/15e79431d85ca05a217ea92adf4ea1f8.jpg" width="50%">

<p>What followed in the next three years was absolute carnage - announcing his arrival with a century, finishing 2011 with 608 runs and the orange cap, 2012 with 733 runs and the orange cap and notching up the highest ever T20 score of 175 in 2013 (which included a 31-ball century) against the Pune Warriors. Soon after, he started calling himself the 'Universe Boss'. Well, nobody could dare disagree. With age catching up, the reflexes slowing down and injuries pulling him back, the consistency began to fall, reaching such a stage in 2017 when he had to be dropped from the eleven. Although reluctantly, KXIP lapped him up in the 2018 auction for the base price, and though not the player of the old, he was a good enough version of himself, winning a couple of matches single-handedly and played a key role in Punjab's success in the first half of the tournament.

                            <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
                            
							<p>Cristiano Ronaldo is a professional soccer player who has set records while playing for the Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus clubs, as well as the Portuguese national team.</p>

<p><b>Who Is Cristiano Ronaldo?</b></p>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro is a Portuguese soccer superstar. By 2003 — when he was just 16 years old — Manchester United paid £12 million (over $14 million U.S. dollars) to sign him, a record fee for a player of his age. </p>

<p>In the 2004 FA Cup final, Ronaldo scored Manchester's first three goals and helped them capture the championship. He set a franchise record for goals scored in 2008, before Real Madrid paid a record $131 million for his services the following year. </p>

<p>Among his many accomplishments, he has won a record-tying five Ballon d'Or awards for player of the year, and led Portugal to an emotional victory in the 2016 European Championship. In July 2018, Ronaldo embarked on a new phase of his career by signing with Italian Serie A club Juventus.</p>

<img src="./Danush Gupta_files/img/MTU2MTQ4NDgxOTY5MzY2NzY4.webp" width="70%">

<p><b>Early Life</b></p>
<p>Ronaldo was born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, a small island off the western coast of the country. Ronaldo is the youngest of four children born to Maria Dolores dos Santos and José Dinis Aveiro. He was named after Ronald Reagan, one of his father's favorite actors.</p>

<p>Ronaldo grew up in a largely working class neighborhood in a small tin-roofed home that overlooked the ocean. Ronaldo was introduced to the game of soccer through his dad, who worked as an equipment manager at a boy's club.</p>

<p>His early life was shaped by hardship, as his father often drank too much. To help keep the children fed and maintain some financial stability, Ronaldo's mother worked as a cook and cleaning person.</p>

<p>In 2005, when Ronaldo was playing for Manchester United, his father died from alcohol-related kidney problems; in 2007, his mother struggled with breast cancer. The former was especially hard for Ronaldo since he and his dad had been close.</p>

<p>The young athlete had often pushed for his father to enter rehab and address his drinking. His father, however, never accepted the offer.</p>

<p>By the time he was 10 years old, Ronaldo was already recognized as a phenomenon — a kid who ate, slept and drank soccer. "All he wanted to do as a boy was play football," his godfather, Fernao Sousa, recalled for British reporters, adding, "He loved the game so much he'd miss meals or escape out of his bedroom window with a ball when he was supposed to be doing his homework."</p>

<p>By his early teens, Ronaldo's talent and legend had grown considerably. After a stint with Nacional da liha da Madeira, he signed with Sporting Portugal in 2001.</p>


<p><b>Cristiano Ronaldo’s Teams</b></p>

<img src="./Danush Gupta_files/img/07aa9e8091390a4ed0a6189a77fcce49.jpg" width="70%">

<p><b>Manchester United</b></p>

<p>In 2001, when Ronaldo was just 16 years old, Manchester United paid more than £12 million to sign him — a record fee for a player of his age.</p>

<p>Ronaldo had turned heads with a mesmerizing performance with Portugal against Manchester, wowing even his opponents with his footwork and deft skill. He made such an impression that a number of United players asked their manager to try and sign the young player, which the team soon did.</p>

<p>Ronaldo did not disappoint the soccer world: He showed his promise early on in the 2004 FA Cup final, scoring the team's first three goals and helping them capture the championship. In 2007, Ronaldo signed a five-year, £31 million contract.</p>

<p>A year later, Ronaldo again justified his high salary when he put together one of the club's finest seasons in history, setting a franchise record for goals scored (42), and earning himself the FIFA World Player of the Year honor for 2008. In all, Ronaldo helped steer Manchester United to three premier league titles.</p>

<p><b>Real Madrid</b></p>

<p>In 2009, the Spanish soccer club Real Madrid agreed to pay Manchester United a record $131 million for the chance to sign Ronaldo. Ronaldo’s commitment to Manchester United had come under constant question, and speculation swirled that he wanted to play elsewhere, so nobody was all that surprised to see Ronaldo leave.</p>

<p>"I know that they are going to demand a lot of me to be successful at the club and I know that I'm going to have much more pressure than at Manchester United because I was there for many years," Ronaldo told reporters. "But it means a new challenge and is going to help me be the best footballer."</p>

<p>Ronaldo went on to compile an impressive list of individual honors and team trophies. In December 2016, he won his fourth Ballon d'Or award as the sport's player of the year, beating out FC Barcelona's Lionel Messi.</p>

<p>Ronaldo’s 2016 wins included the European Championship, Champions League and Club World Cup, plus individual awards from UEFA and France Football magazine. The following year, he claimed a fifth Ballon d'Or to tie the mark held by his longtime rival, Messi.</p>

<p><b>Juventus</b></p>

<p>After dropping hints that his time with Real was coming to an end, Ronaldo confirmed the rumors in July 2018 by signing with Italian Serie A club Juventus, which paid a $140 million transfer fee to his old Spanish club.</p>

<p>Ronaldo paid tribute to Real fans in an open letter on the club's website, writing: "These years at Real Madrid and in this city of Madrid have quite possibly been the happiest years of my life. I only have feelings of great gratitude to this club, to the fans and to the city. I can only give thanks to all of them for the love and affection that I have received."</p>

<p>By most measures, Ronaldo's debut season with Juventus was a successful one. He scored 10 times in his first 14 games, and headed home the lone goal in a win over AC Milan for the Supercoppa Italiana trophy. After leading his club to its eighth consecutive Serie A title, he was named the league's MVP in May 2019.</p>

<p><b>Portugal National Team</b></p>

<p>On July 10, 2016, Ronaldo added an emotional victory to his collection. As his national team's captain, Ronaldo led Portugal to the European Championship final against France.</p>

<p>Although he was sidelined after suffering a knee injury 25 minutes into the match, Portugal went on to win the championship title 1-0, their first international trophy. Ronaldo's teammates said that he motivated them as team captain from the sidelines.</p>

<p>"He gave us a lot of confidence and he said, 'Listen people, I'm sure we will win this Euro so stay together and fight for it,’” fullback Cedric Soares said after Portugal’s victory.</p>

<p>"This is one of the happiest moments in my career,” Ronaldo commented. ”I’ve always said I wanted to win a trophy with the national team and make history. And I did it. Thank God, things went well for us."</p>

<p>Ronaldo got off to a tremendous start at the 2018 World Cup, blasting home three goals in an opening draw vs. Spain, before adding another vs. Morocco to set a European record with his 85th international goal.</p>

<p>However, he was held scoreless in a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in the knockout stage, after which he declined to comment on his future with the national team.</p>

<p><b>Cristiano Ronaldo's Salary</b></p>

<p>After nine years with Real Madrid, Ronaldo took a pay cut in 2018, signing a contract with Juventus for $64 million per year, according to Forbes. In January 2019, he agreed to pay a fine of $21 million for tax evasion between 2010 and 2014.</p>

<p>As of 2017, Ronaldo took home $93 million, according to Forbes, $58 million of which was salary and bonus paid by Real Madrid. Ronaldo’s earnings made him the highest-paid soccer player for the fourth year in a row and the highest-paid professional athlete of 2017. </p>

<p><b>Cristiano Ronaldo’s Girlfriend and Kids</b></p>

<p>Ronaldo is dating the Spanish model Georgina Rodriguez; the couple was first seen together publicly around November 2016.</p>

<p>In June 2017, the couple welcomed twins, a boy and a girl, via a surrogate. In November 2017, Rodriguez added to their family with the birth of another girl.</p>

<p>Ronaldo’s first child, Cristiano Jr., was born to a former girlfriend in June 2010.</p>

<p><b>Cristiano Ronaldo’s Statue at the Madeira Airport</b></p>

<p>In March 2017, self-taught sculptor Emanuel Santos unveiled a bronze bust of Ronaldo at the airport in Ronaldo’s hometown of Madeira, Portugal. The statue was ridiculed for its sinister smile and apparent lack of likeness to its subject, though Santos didn't seem to understand the uproar.</p>

<p>"I asked [Ronaldo] what he thought of the result and he said he liked it," said Santos. "He only asked for some wrinkles that give him a certain expression to his face when he laughs to be changed. He said it made him look older and asked for it to be thinned out a bit to make it smoother and more jovial."</p>

<p>In the wake of the negative publicity, the sports site Bleacher Report commissioned Santos to fashion another sculpture of Ronaldo. This one, unveiled in March 2018, earned praise for more closely resembling the soccer great, though its creator continued to defend his original work.</p>

<p>"I liked the result [of the first bust] and was really proud of it," he told Bleacher Report. "And if I had to do it again, I would make everything exactly the same."</p>

                            <h2>Schooling</h2>
                            <p><strong>Change</strong> has always been a part of my life. In 12 years I had changed 4 schools. My first 2 years of schooling was in Kendriya Vidyalaya. Back then it was just simple: I was very playful. I spent the next 2 years in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Those 2 years were amazing! I studied 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> grades in Middle East International School. I had a lot of fun. School was fun, then we used to go to malls and play all evening in the play area. The only thing irritating over there was ARABIC!! I also used to play cricket and football down in the basement of the flats with friends. Then after 2 years I had to come back. </p>
							
							<p>I was back to Chennai where i joined Chinmaya Vidyalaya Anna Nagar (popularly known as CVA). Who even knew life would be so good there! I spent 6 years in this school: Longest duration in a single school. 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> std were a bit normal. From 7<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup>, I enjoyed a lot. Those 4 years were the golden days of my life! The fun I had was unlimited. We used to play football each and everyday after school. The jokes we made, the punishments we got, the chats we had, were all amazing. The school trip to Delhi, Agra and Jaipur in 9<sup>th</sup> grade was filled with a lot of memories. Then came the 10<sup>th</sup> std board exams! But I had no fear and was enjoying in the computer lab doing annual day background works. Then with a lot of effort, I scored 9.6 CGPA.</p>

<img src="./Danush Gupta_files/img/s7.jpeg" width="50%" align="left">

							<p>I again changed school for 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup>. This time I joined in Velammal Vidyalaya. I enrolled with an IIT course. So I had IIT classes in the morning and CBSE classes in the afternoon. Also I used to have IIT tests every Saturday evening and in 12<sup>th</sup> std I used to have it on Sundays also! So life was all about studies in those 2 years. In 11<sup>th</sup>, I had a very few number of friends. But by the time I reached 12<sup>th</sup>, I expanded my friends circle. But in due course, I also lost some valuable friends which hurt me a lot. Having a bunch of friends was the only reason I survived. They were the elixir of my life. Then came the JEE Mains exam. I got 91 percentile. In about one and a half months I was also having my board exams. So literally there was no time to prepare at all. So I had to study day and night. However I scored 466 out of 500 and thus, my school life came to an end.</p>

							<p> School life was indeed the best part in my life! I did not want it to end this soon...</p>

<img src="./Danush Gupta_files/img/1511247606phpZiZEJb.jpeg" width="70%">
<br>

                            <p>After scoring 466 out of 500 with a cut-off of 187.5 in 12<sup>th</sup> board exams, I got an NRI seat in Madras Institute of Technology, Anna University. MIT is a reputed college. In fact, Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam had graduated from this college. I opted for Computer Science and Engineering branch. I travel to college in local electric train from Nungambakkam to Chrompet as the college is just beside the Chrompet station. One of the highlights of this college is the senior-junior relationship.  All the seniors help their juniors. We had lots and lots of free hours. For example, on Tuesdays we had classes only for the first 2 hours. We were also not given much work for the first 2 months. Having Vetri theatre next to the college was also useful. So college life was happy and peaceful. But after that we were loaded with assignments and continuous assesments. When one assesment gets over, they give us the date for the next one. So it was hectic. However, I studied whatever I could and scored 9.13 GPA in the first semester. To summarise the second semester, number of working days was less than the number of holidays given...</p>

                            <h2>Dogs!</h2>
                            <p>I am an animal lover, especially dogs which are my most favourite animals. They have been some people’s only companies these days as well as (being) human’s best friends for thousands of years. A dog is the only thing on this earth that loves you more than he/it loves himself/itself. This means that they are so loyal and loving that they can make a really wonderful companion. It is also said that a pet dog can feel like a member of a family. People often show their love to their pet dogs in the same way as they do to their children, and the feeling is mutual. What I like the most about this animal is that it/he is always ready to offer its/his unconditional love to its/his owner. You know, even if you’ve been so busy that you haven’t had enough time to give your dog the attention it deserves, it’s still madly waiting for you to come home and welcome you warmly. When you’re feeling down and thinking no one loves you, you always have a canine partner to make you feel better and happier. They never judge and are always happy to see you return, whether you’ve been gone five hours or five minutes. Sometimes these animals may be trained and kept with the aim of helping disabled, lonely, elderly or very ill people or those suffering from blindness, in an attempt to meet such people’s everyday needs, such as opening/closing doors, picking up dropped items, emptying the washing machine, etc. People with dogs are shown to have had less heart problems as well because they get regular exercise from walking their pets. In addition, in terms of mental health, having a dog improves dog owner’s mood and alleviate stress which in turn means lowering blood pressure. However, you have to know how to deal with such animals. What I mean is that, they need constant supervision, attention and caring that includes walking, feeding and exercising them frequently, which means your devoting a great deal of time, effort and energy. I wish I could have one, but unfortunately I dont. I will definetly get one in my future.</p>

							<p>I have a personal experience. When me and my family went to the Yelagiri Hills, during a trek to the Swamimalai Hills present there, a random street dog came with us all the way up the hill and back down! In fact, the dog was acting as the trekking guide. The dog goes in the front and leads the way. It was truly unbeleivable of what a dog can do! That was indeed the best experience of my life!</p>
